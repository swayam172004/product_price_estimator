# ðŸ’° Product Price Estimator

An interactive **Streamlit web app** that predicts product prices based on category, brand, and key features. The app uses a machine learning model built with **scikit-learn** to provide instant price estimates along with model performance scores.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a machine learning model into a simple, user-friendly web interface. Users can select product details such as category, brand, weight, rating, warranty, power usage, and feature score. The app then predicts the product price and shows the modelâ€™s evaluation score for transparency.

Itâ€™s a hands-on project for learning **end-to-end ML deployment** with Streamlit, making it useful for students, developers, and data science enthusiasts.
